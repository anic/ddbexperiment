There are two files in this package:

(1) Tutorial of Course Project.pdf
In this documentation, we present the compulsory and optional requirements. In addition, we discuss some issues of system analysis, design and implementation.

(2) ddb2007_test_student_beta3.pdf
This is the test documentation of ddb course 2007. I think it would be a good example to introduce both the test flow and test data. The pattern of commands is recommended to you all, but you can choose your own command pattern if you want.
